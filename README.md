#### ROAD ACCIDENT SEVERITY

More than 3000 people die in road crashes every day worldwide, including approximately 1000 people in the United States. Such accidents cost $518 billion globally and $230.6 billion per year in the United States. In particular, many young people are affected by traffic accidents, as most traffic accidents are caused by the 15â€“29 age group (Association for Safe International Road Travel Data). Hence, substantial efforts have been made to address the main factors that cause traffic accidents, such as speeding, distracted driving, driver fatigue, road conditions, use of mobile phones, and poor weather conditions.
Regarding bad road conditions due to the weather, previous studies have revealed that there is a strong correlation between road friction coefficient and traffic accident risk. The friction coefficient can be influenced by road conditions such as ice or wetness caused by snow or rainfall. Research has revealed that single-vehicle accidents are mostly caused by wet weather. When a layer of water builds between the tire of a vehicle and the road surface, hydroplaning occurs. If all wheels experience hydroplaning simultaneously, the driver can no longer control the vehicle. It has been shown that hydroplaning occurs at vehicle speeds of 80 km/h on thick water films when the water depth exceeds 2.5 mm. According to the Korean Transportation Safety Authority, the total number of fatalities in road traffic accidents in the country has decreased, but rain-related road deaths increased from 430 in 2013 to 463 in 2016. In particular, in Seoul, the traffic fatality rates on rainy days were the highest among all cities.
Traffic accidents are unpredictable and can happen anywhere and at any time. However, drivers can at least be provided with useful information to help avoid accidents or reduce their probability. The forecasting of traffic accidents and the identification of related factors under various conditions are important for preventing accidents and reducing their frequency. For these reasons, traffic accident prediction models have been developed to reveal the significant factors that affect traffic accidents so that traffic safety can be improved by controlling and/or improving these factors.

#### DATA

 There were 3 datasets considered from different regions, primarily Australia, India and the UK (Link : https://www.kaggle.com/silicon99/dft-accident-data/ ). A few of them have been uploaded. Some of the inferences drawn from the dataset have been added below

## Influence of alcohol consumption on accidents on specific day of the week:

The pie chart shows us that over 61% of the accidents happen over the weekend (Friday-Sunday). This is a major concern and stricter measures of security, increase in police personnel could be two solutions that enforcement agencies can look into in areas of pubs, bars and restaurants over the weekend, so as to attempt in minimizing the rate of accidents

An Indian dataset was considered to analyze the types of vehicles involved in accidents. The highest percentage, which is around 35% is to 2-wheelers. The percentage of heavy vehicles which include trucks, heavy duty lorries, tractors, etc. is also reasonably high. This implies that different vehicles can be dealt with differently. This could mean multiple lanes for different types of vehicles to deal with accidents better.

This is a metric which is defined as total deaths per 100 accidents. The number of vehicles have always been increasing every year, and this could also be a cause in the trend observed in Fig.7.5.4. A small rise can be seen in the years 2012 and 2014. But, a great rise is seen from 2014 to 2016. This implies, an increase in the fatalities per 100 accidents in the 2 years.
